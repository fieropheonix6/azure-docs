# Requirements and considerations for large volumes

This article describes the requirements and considerations you need to be aware of before using [large volumes](azure-netapp-files-understand-storage-hierarchy.md#large-volumes) on Azure NetApp Files.

## Requirements and considerations

The following requirements and considerations apply to large volumes. For performance considerations of *regular volumes*, see [Performance considerations for Azure NetApp Files](azure-netapp-files-performance-considerations.md).

* A regular volume can’t be converted to a large volume.
* You must create a large volume at a size of 50 TiB or larger. A single volume can't exceed 500 TiB.  
* You can't resize a large volume to less than 50 TiB.
    A large volume cannot be resized to less than 30% of its lowest provisioned size. This limit is adjustable via [a support request](azure-netapp-files-resource-limits.md#resource-limits).
* Large volumes are currently not supported with Azure NetApp Files backup.
* You can't create a large volume with application volume groups.
* Currently, large volumes aren't suited for database (HANA, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.) data and log volumes. For database workloads requiring more than a single volume’s throughput limit, consider deploying multiple regular volumes. To optimize multiple volume deployments for databases, use [application volume groups](application-volume-group-concept.md).
* Throughput ceilings for the three performance tiers (Standard, Premium, and Ultra) of large volumes are based on the existing 100-TiB maximum capacity targets. You're able to grow to 500 TiB with the throughput ceiling per the following table:  
    
    | Capacity tier | Volume size (TiB) | Throughput (MiB/s) |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Standard | 50 to 500 | 1,600 |
    | Premium | 50 to 500 | 6,400 | 
    | Ultra | 50 to 500 | 10,240 | 
    
* Large volumes aren't currently supported with standard storage with cool access.

## Supported regions

## Configure large volumes 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Before you can use large volumes, you must first request [an increase in regional capacity quota](azure-netapp-files-resource-limits.md#request-limit-increase).

Once your [regional capacity quota](regional-capacity-quota.md) has increased, you can create volumes that are up to 500 TiB in size. When creating a volume, after you designate the volume quota, you must select **Yes** for the **Large volume** field. Once created, you can manage your large volumes in the same manner as regular volumes. 

### Register the feature 

If this is your first time using large volumes, register the feature with the [large volumes sign-up form](https://aka.ms/anflargevolumessignup).

## Next steps

* [Storage hierarchy of Azure NetApp Files](azure-netapp-files-understand-storage-hierarchy.md)
* [Resource limits for Azure NetApp Files](azure-netapp-files-resource-limits.md)
* [Create an NFS volume](azure-netapp-files-create-volumes.md)
* [Create an SMB volume](azure-netapp-files-create-volumes-smb.md)
* [Create a dual-protocol volume](create-volumes-dual-protocol.md)
