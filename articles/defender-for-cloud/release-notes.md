### New DevOps security recommendations

June 28, 2024

We're announcing DevOps security recommendations that improve the security posture of Azure DevOps and GitHub environments. If issues are found, these recommendations offer remediation steps.

The following new recommendations are supported if you have connected Azure DevOps or GitHub to Microsoft Defender for Cloud. All recommendations are included in Foundational Cloud Security Posture Management. 

| Recommendation name | Description | Severity |
|--|--|--|
| [Azure DevOps repositories should require minimum two-reviewer approval for code pushes](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsBlade/assessmentKey/470742ea-324a-406c-b91f-fc1da6a27c0c) | To prevent unintended or malicious changes from being directly committed, it's important to implement protection policies for the default branch in Azure DevOps repositories. We recommend requiring at least two code reviewers to approve pull requests before the code is merged with the default branch. By requiring approval from a minimum number of two reviewers, you can reduce the risk of unauthorized modifications, which could lead to system instability or security vulnerabilities. | High |
| [Azure DevOps repositories should not allow requestors to approve their own Pull Requests](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsBlade/assessmentKey/98b5895a-0ad8-4ed9-8c9d-d654f5bda816) | To prevent unintended or malicious changes from being directly committed, it's important to implement protection policies for the default branch in Azure DevOps repositories. We recommend prohibiting pull request creators from approving their own submissions to ensure that every change undergoes objective review by someone other than the author. By doing this, you can reduce the risk of unauthorized modifications, which could lead to system instability or security vulnerabilities. | High |
| [GitHub organizations should not make action secrets accessible to all repositories](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsBlade/assessmentKey/6331fad3-a7a2-497d-b616-52672057e0f3) | For secrets used in GitHub Action workflows that are stored at the GitHub organization-level, you can use access policies to control which repositories can use organization secrets. Organization-level secrets let you share secrets between multiple repositories, which reduces the need for creating duplicate secrets. However, once a secret is made accessible to a repository, anyone with write access on repository can access the secret from any branch in a workflow. To reduce the attack surface, ensure that the secret is accessible from selected repositories only. | High |

### General Availability of Checkov IaC Scanning in Defender for Cloud

June 27, 2024

We are announcing the general availability of the Checkov integration for Infrasturcture-as-Code (IaC) scanning through [MSDO](azure-devops-extension.yml). As part of this release, Checkov will be replacing Terrascan as a default IaC analyzer that runs as part of the MSDO CLI. Terrascan may still be configured manually through MSDO's [environment variables](https://github.com/microsoft/security-devops-azdevops/wiki) but will not run by default. 

Security findings from Checkov will be represented as recommendations for both Azure DevOps and GitHub repositories under the assessments "Azure DevOps repositories should have infrastructure as code findings resolved" and "GitHub repositories should have infrastructure as code findings resolved". 

To learn more about DevOps security in Defender for Cloud, see the [DevOps Security Overview](defender-for-devops-introduction.md). To learn how to configure the MSDO CLI, see the [Azure DevOps](azure-devops-extension.yml) or [GitHub](github-action.md) documentation.

### Four security incidents have been deprecated

June 27, 2024

The following security incidents are deprecated from the Defender for Cloud portal:

| Alert | Description | Severity |
|--|--|--|
| **Security incident detected suspicious source IP activity** | This incident indicates that suspicious activity has been detected on the same source IP. Multiple alerts from different Defender for Cloud plans have been triggered on the same IP address, which increases the fidelity of malicious activity in your environment. Suspicious activity on the same IP address might indicate that an attacker has gained unauthorized access to your environment and is attempting to compromise it. | Medium/High |
| **Security incident detected on multiple resources** | This incident indicates that suspicious activity had been detected on your cloud resources. Multiple alerts from different Defender for Cloud plan have been triggered, revealing similar attack methods were performed on your cloud resources. This might indicate a threat actor has gained unauthorized access to your environment and is attempting to compromise it. | Medium/High |
| **Security incident detected compromised machine** | This incident indicates suspicious activity on one or more of your virtual machines. Multiple alerts from different Defender for Cloud plans have been triggered in chronological order on the same resource, following the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This might indicate a threat actor has gained unauthorized access to your environment and successfully compromised this machine.| Medium/High |
| **Security incident detected suspicious virtual machines activity** | This incident indicates suspicious activity on your virtual machines. Multiple alerts from different Defender for Cloud plans have been triggered revealing a similar pattern on your virtual machines. This might indicate a threat actor has gained unauthorized access to your environment and is attempting to compromise it. | Medium/High |

The security value of these incidents are now available through the Microsoft Defender XDR portal. Learn more about [alerts and incidents in Defender XDR](concept-integration-365.md).

### Change in pricing for Defender for Containers in multicloud

June 24, 2024

Since Defender for Containers in multicloud is now generally available, it's no longer free of charge. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Cloud pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/defender-for-cloud/).

### Copilot for Security in Defender for Cloud (Preview)

June 10, 2024

We're announcing the integration of Microsoft Copilot for Security into Defender for Cloud in public preview. Copilot's embedded experience in Defender for Cloud provides users with the ability to ask questions and get answers in natural language. Copilot can help you understand the context of a recommendation, the effect of implementing a recommendation, the steps needed to take to implement a recommendation, assist with the delegation of recommendations, and assist with the remediation of misconfigurations in code.

### General availability of agentless malware detection in Defender for Servers Plan 2

May 30, 2024

We're announcing the release of Defender for Cloud's agentless malware detection for Azure virtual machines (VMs), AWS EC2 instances, and GCP VM instances, as a new feature included in [Defender for Servers Plan 2](plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan.md#plan-features).

Agentless malware detection for VMs is now included in our agentless scanning platform. Agentless malware detection utilizes [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-windows) anti-malware engine to scan and detect malicious files. Any detected threats, trigger security alerts directly into Defender for Cloud and Defender XDR, where they can be investigated and remediated. The Agentless malware scanner complements the agent-based coverage with a second layer of threat detection with frictionless onboarding and has no effect on your machine's performance.

Learn more about [agentless malware scanning](agentless-malware-scanning.md) for servers and [agentless scanning for VMs](concept-agentless-data-collection.md).

### General Availability of Unified Disk Encryption recommendations

May 30, 2024

The following Unified Disk Encryption recommendations are now generally available (GA) within Azure Public Cloud. The recommendations enable customers to audit encryption compliance of virtual machines with Azure Disk Encryption or EncryptionAtHost.

| Recommendation name | Assessment key |
| ---- | ---- |
| [Linux virtual machines should enable Azure Disk Encryption or EncryptionAtHost](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsBlade/assessmentKey/a40cc620-e72c-fdf4-c554-c6ca2cd705c0) | a40cc620-e72c-fdf4-c554-c6ca2cd705c0 |
| [Windows virtual machines should enable Azure Disk Encryption or EncryptionAtHost](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsBlade/assessmentKey/0cb5f317-a94b-6b80-7212-13a9cc8826af) | 0cb5f317-a94b-6b80-7212-13a9cc8826af |

Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) and EncryptionAtHost provide encryption at rest coverage, as described in [Overview of managed disk encryption options - Azure Virtual Machines](/azure/virtual-machines/disk-encryption-overview), and we recommend enabling either of these on virtual machines.

The recommendations depend on [Guest configuration](/azure/governance/machine-configuration/overview). The recommendations in this document are dependent on the configuration of the guest operating system. To ensure that the recommendations can be properly assessed for compliance, it is necessary to enable the required prerequisites on all virtual machines.

These recommendations replace the recommendation [Virtual machines should encrypt temp disks, caches, and data flows between Compute and Storage resources](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/d57a4221-a804-52ca-3dea-768284f06bb7).

### Remediate security baseline recommendation

May 28, 2024

Microsoft Defender for Cloud enhances the Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks by providing security baselines that are powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM). The new recommendation **Machine should be configured securely (powered by MDVM)** helps you secure your servers by providing recommendations that improve your security posture.

### Configure email notifications for attack paths

May 22, 2024

You can now configure email notifications for attack paths in Defender for Cloud. This feature allows you to receive email notifications when an attack path is detected with a specified risk level or higher.

March 31, 2024

We're announcing the general availability (GA) of the Windows container images support for scanning by Defender for Containers.

### Continuous export now includes attack path data

March 25, 2024

We're announcing that continuous export now includes attack path data. This feature allows you to stream security data to Log Analytics in Azure Monitor, to Azure Event Hubs, or to another Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Security Orchestration Automated Response (SOAR), or IT classic deployment model solution.

Learn more about [continuous export](benefits-of-continuous-export.md).

### Agentless scanning supports CMK encrypted VMs in Azure

March 21, 2024

Until now agentless scanning covered CMK encrypted VMs in AWS and GCP. With this release, we're completing support for Azure as well. The capability employs a unique scanning approach for CMK in Azure:

- Defender for Cloud doesn't handle the key or decryption process. Key handling and decryption are seamlessly handled by Azure Compute and is transparent to Defender for Cloud's agentless scanning service.
- The unencrypted VM disk data is never copied or re-encrypted with another key.
- The original key isn't replicated during the process. Purging it eradicates the data on both your production VM and Defender for Cloud’s temporary snapshot.

During public preview this capability isn't automatically enabled. If you're using Defender for Servers P2 or Defender CSPM and your environment has VMs with CMK encrypted disks, you can now have them scanned for vulnerabilities, secrets, and malware following these [enablement steps](enable-agentless-scanning-vms.md#agentless-vulnerability-assessment-on-azure).

- [Learn more on agentless scanning for VMs](concept-agentless-data-collection.md)
- [Learn more on agentless scanning permissions](faq-permissions.yml#which-permissions-are-used-by-agentless-scanning-)

### New endpoint detection and response recommendations

March 18, 2024

We're announcing new endpoint detection and response recommendations that discover and assesses the configuration of supported endpoint detection and response solutions. If issues are found, these recommendations offer remediation steps.

The following new agentless endpoint protection recommendations are now available if you have Defender for Servers Plan 2 or the Defender CSPM plan enabled on your subscription with the agentless machine scanning feature enabled. The recommendations support Azure and multicloud machines. On-premises machines aren't supported.

| Recommendation name | Description | Severity |
|--|
| [EDR solution should be installed on Virtual Machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/) | To protect virtual machines, install an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution.

### New insight for active repositories in Cloud Security Explorer

January 31, 2024

A new insight for Azure DevOps repositories has been added to the Cloud Security Explorer to indicate whether repositories are active. This insight indicates that the code repository is not archived or disabled, meaning that write access to code, builds, and pull requests is still available for users. Archived and disabled repositories might be considered lower priority as the code isn't typically used in active deployments.

To test out the query through Cloud Security Explorer, use [this query link](https://ms.portal.azure.com#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/SecurityGraph.ReactView/query/%7B%22type%22%3A%22securitygraphquery%22%2C%22version%22%3A2%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%22source%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22datasource%22%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%22sources%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22entity%22%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%22source%22%3A%22azuredevopsrepository%22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22conditions%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22conditiongroup%22%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%22operator%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22conditions%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22insights%22%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%22name%22%3A%226b8f221b-c0ce-48e3-9fbb-16f917b1c095%22%7D%7D%5D%7D%7D%7D%7D%7D%7D).

### Public preview of agentless malware scanning for servers

January 16, 2024

We're announcing the release of Defender for Cloud's agentless malware detection for Azure virtual machines (VM), AWS EC2 instances and GCP VM instances, as a new feature included in [Defender for Servers Plan 2](plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan.md#plan-features).

Agentless malware detection for VMs is now included in our agentless scanning platform. Agentless malware scanning utilizes [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-windows) anti-malware engine to scan and detect malicious files. Any detected threats, trigger security alerts directly into Defender for Cloud and Defender XDR, where they can be investigated and remediated. The Agentless malware scanner complements the agent-based coverage with a second layer of threat detection with frictionless onboarding and has no effect on your machine's performance.

### Recommendations released for preview: Nine new Azure security recommendations

January 4, 2024

We have added nine new Azure security recommendations aligned with the Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark. These new recommendations are currently in public preview.

|Recommendation | Description  | Severity |
|----------|----------|----------|
| [Cognitive Services accounts should have local authentication methods disabled](recommendations-reference.md#identity-and-access-recommendations) | Disabling local authentication methods improves security by ensuring that Cognitive Services accounts require Azure Active Directory identities exclusively for authentication. Learn more at: <https://aka.ms/cs/auth>. (Related policy: [Cognitive Services accounts should have local authentication methods disabled](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f71ef260a-8f18-47b7-abcb-62d0673d94dc)). | Low |
| [Cognitive Services should use private link](recommendations-reference.md#data-recommendations) | Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual networks to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Cognitive Services, you'll reduce the potential for data leakage. Learn more about [private links](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129800). (Related policy: [Cognitive Services should use private link](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fcddd188c-4b82-4c48-a19d-ddf74ee66a01)). | Medium |
| [Virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets should have encryption at host enabled](recommendations-reference.md#compute-recommendations) | Use encryption at host to get end-to-end encryption for your virtual machine and virtual machine scale set data. Encryption at host enables encryption at rest for your temporary disk and OS/data disk caches. Temporary and ephemeral OS disks are encrypted with platform-managed keys when encryption at host is enabled. OS/data disk caches are encrypted at rest with either customer-managed or platform-managed key, depending on the encryption type selected on the disk. Learn more at <https://aka.ms/vm-hbe>.

| [Azure SQL Database should be running TLS version 1.2 or newer](recommendations-reference.md#data-recommendations) | Setting TLS version to 1.2 or newer improves security by ensuring your Azure SQL Database can only be accessed from clients using TLS 1.2 or newer. Using versions of TLS less than 1.2 is not recommended since they have well documented security vulnerabilities. (Related policy: [Azure SQL Database should be running TLS version 1.2 or newer](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f32e6bbec-16b6-44c2-be37-c5b672d103cf)). | Medium |
| [Azure SQL Managed Instances should disable public network access](recommendations-reference.md#data-recommendations) | Disabling public network access (public endpoint) on Azure SQL Managed Instances improves security by ensuring that they can only be accessed from inside their virtual networks or via Private Endpoints. Learn more about [public network access](https://aka.ms/mi-public-endpoint). (Related policy: [Azure SQL Managed Instances should disable public network access](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f9dfea752-dd46-4766-aed1-c355fa93fb91)). | Medium |
| [Storage accounts should prevent shared key access](recommendations-reference.md#data-recommendations) | Audit requirement of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to authorize requests for your storage account. By default, requests can be authorized with either Azure Active Directory credentials, or by using the account access key for Shared Key authorization. Of these two types of authorization, Azure AD provides superior security and ease of use over shared Key, and is recommended by Microsoft. (Related policy: [Storage accounts should prevent shared key access](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f8c6a50c6-9ffd-4ae7-986f-5fa6111f9a54)). |Medium |

### Consolidation of Defender for Cloud's Service Level 2 names

December 30, 2023

We're consolidating the legacy Service Level 2 names for all Defender for Cloud plans into a single new Service Level 2 name, **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

Today, there are four Service Level 2 names: Azure Defender, Advanced Threat Protection, Advanced Data Security, and Security Center. The various meters for Microsoft Defender for Cloud are grouped across these separate Service Level 2 names, creating complexities when using Cost Management + Billing, invoicing, and other Azure billing-related tools.

The change simplifies the process of reviewing Defender for Cloud charges and provides better clarity in cost analysis.

To ensure a smooth transition, we've taken measures to maintain the consistency of the Product/Service name, SKU, and Meter IDs. Impacted customers will receive an informational Azure Service Notification to communicate the changes.

Organizations that retrieve cost data by calling our APIs, will need to update the values in their calls to accommodate the change. For example, in this filter function, the values will return no information:

```json
"filter": {
          "dimensions": {
              "name": "MeterCategory",
              "operator": "In",
              "values": [
                  "Advanced Threat Protection",
                  "Advanced Data Security",
                  "Azure Defender",
                  "Security Center"
                ]
          }
      }
```

| OLD Service Level 2 name | NEW Service Level 2 name | Service Tier - Service Level 4 (No change) |
|--|--|--|
|Advanced Data Security    |Microsoft Defender for Cloud|Defender for SQL|
|Advanced Threat Protection|Microsoft Defender for Cloud|Defender for Container Registries |
|Advanced Threat Protection|Microsoft Defender for Cloud|Defender for DNS |

### Defender for Servers at the resource level available as GA

December 24, 2023

It's now possible to manage Defender for Servers on specific resources within your subscription, giving you full control over your protection strategy. With this capability, you can configure specific resources with custom configurations that differ from the settings configured at the subscription level.

Learn more about [enabling Defender for Servers at the resource level](tutorial-enable-servers-plan.md#enable-defender-for-servers-at-the-resource-level).

### Retirement of Classic connectors for multicloud

December 21, 2023

The classic multicloud connector experience is retired and data is no longer streamed to connectors created through that mechanism. These classic connectors were used to connect AWS Security Hub and GCP Security Command Center recommendations to Defender for Cloud and onboard AWS EC2s to Defender for Servers.

The full value of these connectors has been replaced with the native multicloud security connectors experience, which has been Generally Available for AWS and GCP since March 2022 at no extra cost.

The new native connectors are included in your plan and offer an automated onboarding experience with options to onboard single accounts, multiple accounts (with Terraform), and organizational onboarding with auto provisioning for the following Defender plans: free foundational CSPM capabilities, Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), Defender for Servers, Defender for SQL, and Defender for Containers.

### Release of the Coverage workbook

December 21, 2023

The Coverage workbook allows you to keep track of which Defender for Cloud plans are active on which parts of your environments. This workbook can help you to ensure that your environments and subscriptions are fully protected. By having access to detailed coverage information, you can also identify any areas that might need other protection and take action to address those areas.
