# Security recommendations

This article lists all the security recommendations you might see in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. The recommendations that appear in your environment are based on the resources that you're protecting and on your customized configuration.

Recommendations in Defender for Cloud are based on the [Microsoft cloud security benchmark](/security/benchmark/azure/introduction). The Microsoft cloud security benchmark is the Microsoft-authored set of guidelines for security and compliance best practices. This widely respected benchmark builds on controls from the [Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/azure/) and the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/), with a focus on cloud-centric security.

To learn about actions that you can take in response to these recommendations, see [Remediate recommendations in Defender for Cloud](implement-security-recommendations.md).

Your secure score is based on the number of security recommendations you completed. To decide which recommendations to resolve first, look at the severity of each recommendation and its potential impact on your secure score.

> [!TIP]
> If a recommendation's description says *No related policy*, usually it's because that recommendation is dependent on a different recommendation and *its* policy.
>
> For example, the recommendation *Endpoint protection health failures should be remediated* relies on the recommendation that checks whether an endpoint protection solution is even installed (*Endpoint protection solution should be installed*). The underlying recommendation *does* have a policy. Limiting the policies to only the foundational recommendation simplifies policy management.

**Description**: Recommendations to use customer-managed keys for encryption of data at rest are not assessed by default, but are available to enable for applicable scenarios. Data is encrypted automatically using platform-managed keys, so the use of customer-managed keys should only be applied when obligated by compliance or restrictive policy requirements.
To enable this recommendation, navigate to your Security Policy for the applicable scope, and update the *Effect* parameter for the corresponding policy to audit or enforce the use of customer-managed keys. Learn more in [Manage security policies](tutorial-security-policy.md).
Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of the contents of your registries. By default, the data is encrypted at rest with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys (CMK) are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. CMKs enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. Learn more about CMK encryption at <https://aka.ms/acr/CMK>.

**Description**: Restrict pod access to the host network and the allowable host port range in a Kubernetes cluster. Pods created with the hostNetwork attribute enabled will share the node's network space. To avoid compromised container from sniffing network traffic, we recommend not putting your pods on the host network. If you need to expose a container port on the node's network, and using a Kubernetes Service node port does not meet your needs, another possibility is to specify a hostPort for the container in the pod spec.

**Description**: If you only use passwords to authenticate your users, you're leaving an attack vector open. Users often use weak passwords for multiple services. By enabling [multifactor authentication](multi-factor-authentication-enforcement.md) (MFA), you provide better security for your accounts, while still allowing your users to authenticate to almost any application with single sign-on (SSO). Multifactor authentication is a process by which users are prompted, during the sign-in process, for another form of identification. For example, a code might be sent to their cellphone, or they might be asked for a fingerprint scan. We recommend you to enable MFA for all accounts that have [owner permissions](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner) on Azure resources, to prevent breach and attacks.

**Description**: Protect your subnet from potential threats by restricting access to it with a network security group (NSG). NSGs contain a list of Access Control List (ACL) rules that allow or deny network traffic to your subnet. When an NSG is associated with a subnet, the ACL rules apply to all the VM instances and integrated services in that subnet, but don't apply to internal traffic inside the subnet. To secure resources in the same subnet from one another, enable NSG directly on the resources as well.
Note that the following subnet types will be listed as not applicable: GatewaySubnet, AzureFirewallSubnet, AzureBastionSubnet.
(Related policy: [Subnets should be associated with a Network Security Group](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fe71308d3-144b-4262-b144-efdc3cc90517)).

## API recommendations

### Microsoft Defender for APIs should be enabled

**Description & related policy**: Enable the Defender for APIs plan to discover and protect API resources against attacks and security misconfigurations. [Learn more](defender-for-apis-deploy.md)

**Severity**: High

### Azure API Management APIs should be onboarded to Defender for APIs

**Description & related policy**: Onboarding APIs to Defender for APIs requires compute and memory utilization on the Azure API Management service. Monitor performance of your Azure API Management service while onboarding APIs, and scale out your Azure API Management resources as needed.

**Severity**: High

### API endpoints that are unused should be disabled and removed from the Azure API Management service

**Description & related policy**: As a security best practice, API endpoints that haven't received traffic for 30 days are considered unused, and should be removed from the Azure API Management service. Keeping unused API endpoints might pose a security risk. These might be APIs that should have been deprecated from the Azure API Management service, but have accidentally been left active. Such APIs typically do not receive the most up-to-date security coverage.

**Severity**: Low

### API endpoints in Azure API Management should be authenticated

**Description & related policy**: API endpoints published within Azure API Management should enforce authentication to help minimize security risk. Authentication mechanisms are sometimes implemented incorrectly or are missing. This allows attackers to exploit implementation flaws and to access data. For APIs published in Azure API Management, this recommendation assesses authentication through verifying the presence of Azure API Management subscription keys for APIs or products where subscription is required, and the execution of policies for validating [JWT](../api-management/validate-jwt-policy.md), [client certificates](../api-management/validate-client-certificate-policy.md), and [Microsoft Entra](../api-management/validate-azure-ad-token-policy.md) tokens. If none of these authentication mechanisms are executed during the API call, the API will receive this recommendation.

**Severity**: High

## API management recommendations

### API Management subscriptions should not be scoped to all APIs

**Description & related policy**: API Management subscriptions should be scoped to a product or an individual API instead of all APIs, which could result in excessive data exposure.

**Severity**: Medium

### API Management calls to API backends should not bypass certificate thumbprint or name validation

**Description & related policy**: API Management should validate the backend server certificate for all API calls. Enable SSL certificate thumbprint and name validation to improve the API security.

**Severity**: Medium

### API Management direct management endpoint should not be enabled

**Description & related policy**: The direct management REST API in Azure API Management bypasses Azure Resource Manager role-based access control, authorization, and throttling mechanisms, thus increasing the vulnerability of your service.

**Severity**: Low

### API Management APIs should use only encrypted protocols

**Description & related policy**: APIs should be available only through encrypted protocols, like HTTPS or WSS. Avoid using unsecured protocols, such as HTTP or WS to ensure security of data in transit.

**Severity**: High

### API Management secret named values should be stored in Azure Key Vault

**Description & related policy**: Named values are a collection of name and value pairs in each API Management service. Secret values can be stored either as encrypted text in API Management (custom secrets) or by referencing secrets in Azure Key Vault. Reference secret named values from Azure Key Vault to improve security of API Management and secrets. Azure Key Vault supports granular access management and secret rotation policies.

**Severity**: Medium

### API Management should disable public network access to the service configuration endpoints
