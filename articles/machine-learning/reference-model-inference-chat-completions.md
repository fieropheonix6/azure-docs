# Reference: Chat Completions | Azure Machine Learning

Creates a model response for the given chat conversation.

```http
POST /chat/completions?api-version=2024-04-01-preview
```

## URI Parameters

| Name | In  | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| api-version | query | True | string | The version of the API in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" or "YYYY-MM-DD-preview". |

## Request Body

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| messages | True | [ChatCompletionRequestMessage](#chatcompletionrequestmessage) | A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. Returns a 422 error if at least some of the messages can't be understood by the model. |
| frequency\_penalty |     | number | Helps prevent word repetitions by reducing the chance of a word being selected if it has already been used. The higher the frequency penalty, the less likely the model is to repeat the same words in its output. Return a 422 error if value or parameter is not supported by model. |
| max\_tokens |     | integer | The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion.<br><br>The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length. Passing null causes the model to use its max context length. |
| presence\_penalty |     | number | Helps prevent the same topics from being repeated by penalizing a word if it exists in the completion already, even just once. Return a 422 error if value or parameter is not supported by model. |
| response\_format |     | [ChatCompletionResponseFormat](#chatcompletionresponseformat) |     |
| seed |     | integer | If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend. |
| stop |     |     | Sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. |
| stream |     | boolean | If set, partial message deltas will be sent. Tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. |
| temperature |     | number | Non-negative number. Return 422 if value is unsupported by model. |
| tool\_choice |     | [ChatCompletionToolChoiceOption](#chatcompletiontoolchoiceoption) | Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. `none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that function.<br><br>`none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if functions are present. Returns a 422 error if the tool is not supported by the model. |
| tools |     | [ChatCompletionTool](#chatcompletiontool)\[\] | A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. Returns a 422 error if the tool is not supported by the model. |
| top\_p |     | number | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.<br><br>We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both. |

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The Riemann Conjecture is a deep mathematical conjecture around prime numbers and how they can be predicted. It was first published in Riemann's groundbreaking 1859 paper. The conjecture states that the Riemann zeta function has its zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with real part 1/21. Many consider it to be the most important unsolved problem in pure mathematics. The Riemann hypothesis is a way to predict the probability that numbers in a certain range are prime that was also devised by German mathematician Bernhard Riemann in 18594."
