# Monitor Azure and Off-Azure Virtual machines with Azure Monitor SCOM Managed Instance (preview)

>[!NOTE]
>This feature is currently in preview.

Azure Monitor SCOM Managed Instance provides a cloud-based alternative for Operations Manager users providing monitoring continuity for cloud and on-premises environments across the cloud adoption journey.

## SCOM Managed Instance Agent

In Azure Monitor SCOM Managed Instance, an agent is a service that is installed on a computer that looks for configuration data and proactively collects information for analysis and reporting, measures the health state of monitored objects like an SQL database or logical disk, and executes tasks on demand by an operator or in response to a condition. It allows SCOM Managed Instance to monitor Windows operating systems and the components installed on them, such as a website or an Active Directory domain controller.

## Support for Azure and Off-Azure workloads

One of the most important monitoring scenarios is that of on-premises (off-Azure) workloads that unlock SCOM Managed Instance as a true **Hybrid monitoring solution**.

The following are the supported monitoring scenarios:

|Type of endpoint|Trust|Experience|
|---|---|---|
|Azure VM |Any type|Azure portal|
|Arc VM |Any type|Azure portal|
|Line of sight on-premises agent|Trusted|OpsConsole|
|Line of sight on-premises agent|Untrusted|Managed Gateway and OpsConsole|
|No Line of sight on-premises agent|Trusted/Untrusted|Managed Gateway and OpsConsole|

SCOM Managed Instance users will be able to:
- Monitor VMs and applications which are in untrusted domain/workgroup.
- Onboard endpoints (including Agent installation and setup) seamlessly from SCOM Managed Instance portal.
- Set up and manage Gateways seamlessly from SCOM Managed Instance portal on Arc-enabled servers for off-Azure monitoring.
- Set high availability at Gateway plane for agent failover as described in [Designing for High Availability and Disaster Recovery](/system-center/scom/plan-hadr-design).

## Linux monitoring with SCOM Managed Instance

With SCOM Managed Instance, you can monitor Linux workloads that are on-premises and behind a gateway server. At this stage, we don't support monitoring Linux VMs hosted in Azure. For more information, see [How to monitor on-premises Linux VMs](/system-center/scom/manage-deploy-crossplat-agent-console).

For more information, see [Azure Monitor SCOM Managed Instance frequently asked questions](scom-managed-instance-faq.yml).

## Use Arc channel for Agent configuration and monitoring data

Azure Arc can unlock connectivity and monitor on-premises workloads. Azure based manageability of monitoring agents for SCOM Managed Instance helps you to reduce operations cost and simplify agent configuration. The following are the key capabilities of SCOM Managed Instance monitoring over Arc channel:

- Discover and Install SCOM Managed Instance agent as a VM extension for Arc connected servers.
- Monitor Arc connected servers and hosted applications by reusing existing System Center Operations Manager management packs.
- Azure based SCOM Managed Instance agent management (such as patch, push management pack rules and monitors) via Arc connectivity.
- SCOM Managed Instance agents to relay monitoring data back to SCOM Managed Instance via Arc connectivity.

## Prerequisites

Following are the prerequisites required on desired monitoring endpoints that are Virtual machines:

1. Ensure to Allowlist the following Azure URL on the desired monitoring endpoints:
      `*.workloadnexus.azure.com`
2. Confirm the Line of sight between SCOM Managed Instance and desired monitoring endpoints by running the following command. Obtain LB DNS information by navigating to SCOM Managed Instance **Overview** > **DNS Name**.

    ```    
    Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <LB DNS> -Port 5723
    ```
3. Ensure to install [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/microsoft-net-framework-4-7-2-offline-installer-for-windows-05a72734-2127-a15d-50cf-daf56d5faec2) or higher on desired monitoring endpoints.
4. Ensure TLS 1.2 or higher is enabled.
